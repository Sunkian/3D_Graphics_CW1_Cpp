This is the "README" for the Coursework1;
You can alternate the main file between:
- main.cpp : shows 10 different cubes with a lamp pointing at the first one (the one with the textures), with light
- Texture_Only.cpp :shows 10 different cubes, all having texures, and with light
- Cube_Shines.cpp : only one cube (pink one) where a lamp shines on it.
- Image_turns : an image turns, to show the different tranformation movement (translation, scaling, rotation)
